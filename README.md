# Automation-Anywhere
A JavaScript based drag and drop workflow builder. This is to be used as part of a greater project to allow everyday users to bring automation to their jobs in a similar way to how Power Automate works.

This is only part of a bigger project i'm working on and uses Flowy.js at its core. Please feel free to re-use this however you wish.

## Important Information
I know my JavaScript formatting is **GARBAGE** and can likely be simplified significantly. I don't worry about that whist im prototyping however if you would like to fix it (as i won't be for now), please feel free to contribute.

If you have any other suggestions on how this can be improved, drop me a message.

## How To Use
1. Download the three main files and the assets folder that can be found in the main branch
2. Open the index.html file in your favourite web browser.
